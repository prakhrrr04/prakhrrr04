### Hi there, I'm Prakhrrr 👋

I'm a 3rd-year Electrical Engineering undergrad passionate about solving and contributing to real-world problems.  
Currently preparing for software engineering internships (Winter '25, Summer '26) with a focus on full-stack development, DSA, and system design while enjoying Competitive Programming and problem solving.

🔭 I’m currently working on:  
- A React-based **Movie Watchlist Web App**  
- A **Streamlit project** optimizing e-commerce return logistics using sales & stock data  

🌱 I’m also learning:  
- Competitive Programming (Codeforces, Leetcode)  
- Operating Systems, DBMS, and Computer Networks  
- Firebase Auth & Firestore  

🧩 Solving problems in code the same way I chase shuttles: with precision and persistence 🏸
